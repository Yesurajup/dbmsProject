<h1> Blood Donation Management</h1>
<p>You can create a database project for a blood donation clinic. You should start by adding donor names and assign them unique IDs. Add their details and relevant information such as blood type, medical report, and contact number. Similarly, add patient names with unique IDs, details on their medical conditions, and blood types. 

After you’ve created a database of patients and donors, you can work on a database for the blood bank. There, you’ll have to add the name of the blood bank, its staff details, operating hours, and address.</p>
